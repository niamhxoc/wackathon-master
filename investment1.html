    <p><b>Investments are something you buy or put your money into to get a
      profitable return.</b>
      Most people choose from four main types of investment, known as
      ‘asset classes’:
      <ul>
        <li>Shares - you buy a stake in a company</li>
        <li>Cash – the savings you put in a bank or building society account</li>
        <li>Property – you invest in a physical building, whether commercial or residential</li>
        <li>Fixed interest securities (also called bonds) - you loan your money to a company or government</li>
      </ul>
      <br>There are other types of investments available too, including:
      <ul>
  <li>Foreign currency</li>
  <li>Collectibles, such as art and antiques</li>
  <li>Commodities like oil, coffee, corn, rubber or gold</li>
  <li>Contracts for difference, where you bet on shares gaining or losing value</li>
  <br>The various assets owned by an investor are called a <b>portfolio</b>.<br>
  As a general rule, spreading your money between the different types of asset
  classes helps lower the risk of your overall portfolio under performing –

          Unit trusts and Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) are
          professionally managed collective investment funds. A fund manager
          pools money from many investors and buys shares, bonds, property or
          cash assets and other investments.
          The value of your investments can go down as well as up and you might
          get back less than you invested.
          Some assets are riskier than others. But higher risk also gives you
          the potential to earn higher returns. Before investing, make sure you
          understand what kind of assets the fund invests in and whether that’s
          a good fit for your investment goals, financial situation and
          attitude to risk.
          Unit trusts and OEICs help you to spread your risk across lots of
          investments without having to spend a lot of money.

          Investment bonds are life insurance policies where you invest a lump
          sum in a variety of available funds. Some investment bonds run for a
          fixed term, others have no set investment term. When you cash
          investment bonds in, how much you get back depends on how well –
          or how badly – the investment has done.

        You can invest in property in two ways – directly or indirectly. Both
        ways involve some complicated financial issues, and one of those is tax.
        You should do your best to minimise tax to get the most out of your
        investment. <br>
        <b>Direct property</b> investment means you buy all or part of the property
        yourself. Property tends to increase in value over time, and, in the
        meantime, you can rent it out or live in it. <br>
        <b>Indirect property</b> investment means you don’t directly own the property,
        but you do get a share of the profits. You buy into a property fund or
        company and get dividends and/or capital growth when the fund makes a
        profit.

  <p>None of us likes to gamble with our savings but the truth is there’s no
    such thing as a <b>‘no-risk’ investment</b>.
    You’re always taking on some risk when you invest, but the amount
    varies between different types of investment.
    Money you place in secure deposits such as savings accounts risks losing
    value in real terms (buying power) over time. This is because the interest
    rate paid <b>won’t always keep up with rising prices (inflation)</b>.
    On the other hand, index-linked investments that follow the rate of
    inflation don’t always follow market interest rates. This means that if
    inflation falls you could earn less in interest than you expected.
    <br><br>Stock market investments might beat inflation and interest rates over time, but
    you run the risk that prices might be low at the time you need to sell.
    This could result in a poor return or, if prices are lower than when you
    bought, losing money.
    When you start investing, it’s usually a good idea to spread your risk
    by putting your money into a number of different products and asset classes.
    That way, if one investment doesn’t work out as you hope, you’ve still got
    your others to fall back on.

                  A pre-investor is simply someone who isn't investing.<br>
                  Pre-investors are characterized by minimal financial consciousness
                   or awareness. There's little thought of investing, and there's
                   correspondingly little savings or investment to show for that
                    minimal thought.

                  The passive investor type usually employs all the basics of
                  sound personal financial planning: own your own home, fund
                  tax deferred retirement plans, asset allocation, and save at
                  least 10% of earnings.<br>
                  If you follow these foundational principles and begin
                  early enough in life, then passive investing is likely
                  all you'll ever need to attain financial security.
                  <br>
                  Passive investment strategy is good for people with busy lives,
                  families, jobs, outside interests, or entrepreneurs building
                  businesses.

                  The primary difference between active and passive investors
                  is the active investor not only receives market based passive
                  returns, but he also gains a value-added return stream based
                  on skill; two sources of return in one investment. <br>
                  This allows the active investor to make money regardless of
                  market conditions or direction and to reduce losses during
                  periods of adversity. This holds the potential to increase
                  returns and lower risk.
