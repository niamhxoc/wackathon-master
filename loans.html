    <h2> all about types of loan. </h2>
  </div>

  <div id="loan_intro" align="justify">
    <p>Loan contracts come in all kinds of forms and with varied terms, ranging
      from simple promissory notes between friends and family members to more
      complex loans like mortgage, auto, payday and student loans.
      Banks, credit unions and other people lend money for significant, but necessary
      items like a car or home.
      Before going for commercial debt, it's worth seeing if there are any Government
      loans available to you. There are two types you might be eligible for:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Local help:</b> Since April 2013, each local authority has been responsible
          for providing help to residents struggling with an emergency. This can
          include you or your family's health being at risk, not being able to
          afford to buy food, needing help to stay in your own home and coming
          out of care, hospital or prison.
          Sadly, this is a postcode lottery. Each council can choose whether
          to offer financial help or not, and councils can decide who is eligible.
          Some may give furniture or food grants, others may give cash.</li>
          <li><b>National help:</b> The next type are budgeting loans and advances.
          These are only for those receiving benefits and with no or low savings.
          They allow for a wide range of borrowing, to pay for items
          including school uniform or furnishings.</li>
      </ul>

          A consolidation loan is meant to simplify your finances. Simply put,
          a consolidation loan pays off all or several of your outstanding debts,
          particularly credit card debt. It means fewer monthly payments and lower
          interest rates. Consolidation loans are typically in the form of second
          mortgages or personal loans.

          Personal loans can be used for any personal expenses and donâ€™t have a
          designated purpose. This makes them an attractive option for people
          with outstanding debts, such as credit card debt, who want to reduce
          their interest rates by transferring balances. Like other loans,
          personal loan terms depend on your credit history.
