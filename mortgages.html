    <p>A mortgage is a loan taken out to buy property or land. Most run for 25
      years but the term can be shorter or longer.
      The loan is ‘secured’ against the value of your home until it’s paid off. If
      you can’t keep up your repayments the lender can repossess (take back) your home
      and sell it so they get their money back.
      <br>
      Mortgages come in many forms. The most popular mortgages are a 30-year fixed and
      a 15-year fixed. Some mortgages can be as short as five years; some can be 40 years
      or longer. Stretching payments over more years reduces the monthly payment but
      increases the amount of interest to pay.
      <br>
      With a fixed-rate mortgage, the borrower pays the same interest rate for the
      life of the loan. The monthly principal and interest payment never changes from
      the first mortgage payment to the last. If market interest rates rise, the
      borrower’s payment does not change. If interest rates drop significantly, the
      borrower may be able to secure that lower rate by refinancing the mortgage. A
      fixed-rate mortgage is also called a “traditional" mortgage.

    <p><b>Here are our top tips for successfully securing a mortgage:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dont expect ever lender to accept you</b><br>
          Every lender has its own method to decide whether it wants to lend
          to you. If you fit a lender's criteria, you'll most probably be
          accepted quickly. If you're far from ideal, you'll most likely
          be rejected by it. But for people in the middle, it's more of a
          grey area and the lender's scorecard will be based on several factors,
          such as the size of loan you want to take out and how much you've
          saved as a deposit.</li>
        <li><b>Check your credit status early</b><br>
          You need to convince
          lenders that you've got the financial discipline required to pay
          back your mortgage. One way they investigate this is by searching
          your credit report(s) to find out if you've a good repayment history.
          Your credit report lists your past credit cards, loans, overdrafts,
          mortgages and even mobile phone and some utility payments, for all
          accounts that were open over the past six years.
          <br>It used to be that you'd have to pay to get your credit report,
          but since the introduction of GDPR in May 2018, you can now get them
          all for free. It is worth checking all of them are up to scratch, as
          you don't know which one(s) your future mortgage lender will check.</li>
        <li><b>Register to vote!</b><br>
          This is a dealbreaker. While you can have a perfect credit score
          without being on the electoral roll, it's still ALMOST impossible
          to get a mortgage without it. Lenders use electoral roll data in
          identity checks (to ensure you are who you say you are, and live
          where you say you live and that you're not laundering money).
          Your credit file will say if you're on the electoral roll or not,
          but you can also check with your local council. Do this as early as
          possible. While you can usually be added within a month, in late
          summer and early autumn it could take longer. If you're not on it, you
          can register on the electoral roll for free.</li>
